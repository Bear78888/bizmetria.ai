# BizMetria Project Status

**As of:** 2026-07-30  
**Overall status:** `PHASE 1 IN PROGRESS` \
**Verified `main` SHA:** `b6174f1325136bc69a9859925c570e5770972991`

## Current phase

Recovery PR [#1](https://github.com/Bear78888/bizmetria.ai/pull/1), architecture PR [#2](https://github.com/Bear78888/bizmetria.ai/pull/2), Delivery Roadmap PR [#3](https://github.com/Bear78888/bizmetria.ai/pull/3), Product Blueprint PR [#5](https://github.com/Bear78888/bizmetria.ai/pull/5), and Legal/Data Baseline PR [#6](https://github.com/Bear78888/bizmetria.ai/pull/6) are merged. `main` contains the approved governance, roadmap, product blueprint, and legal/data issue-spotting baseline.

Gate `G0 — Governance Ready` is `PASS` because:

- `MC-001` is merged and verified;
- `MC-002` is independently reviewed, merged, and verified;
- the Decision Log, Project Status, Task Queue, Registry, Active Work, Master Continuation, and Workstream 01 state are synchronized;
- `PS-001` and `LS-001` were the only initial execution assignments and are now approved.

`PS-002 — Owner Decision Package` is now the only ready execution task. It prepares options and recommendations but does not approve owner decisions. No Phase 2 implementation task is authorized before `MC-003` records the owner choices and `G1` passes.

## Confirmed product baseline

- Brand `BizMetria.ai` and cross-industry scope.
- English and Spanish launch with separate language numbers and a shared backend.
- $299 one-time Business Assessment; no subscription.
- Implementation sold separately.
- Free AI Opportunity Check as the primary cold-traffic path.
- Eleven free-audit topics plus contact/consent structure.
- Deterministic 0–100 score with five block maxima 30/25/20/15/10.
- Paid-assessment baseline, manual MVP report review, and consultation.
- Stripe Promotion Codes and $49–$199 discount boundary.
- $199 discount restricted to late reactivation and not advertised in advance.

## Active and next work

| Task | Owner | Status | Branch / dependency |
|---|---|---|---|
| MC-001 Master Orchestrator and Workstream Architecture Migration | Master Orchestrator | APPROVED | PR [#2](https://github.com/Bear78888/bizmetria.ai/pull/2), merge SHA `473ee6c042bd5224bec75dbc18fa803e9b148aa3` |
| MC-002 Delivery Roadmap and Phase Gates | Master Orchestrator | APPROVED | PR [#3](https://github.com/Bear78888/bizmetria.ai/pull/3), merge SHA `713c17e2ca854ce65125d65382dedee3fcec6d9c` |
| G0 Governance Ready | Master Orchestrator | PASS | MC-001 and MC-002 merged; canonical status records synchronized |
| PS-001 Product Blueprint v0.1 | Product Strategy | APPROVED | PR [#5](https://github.com/Bear78888/bizmetria.ai/pull/5), merge SHA `21d223223180e7a7d617f28648674efb613c4a92` |
| LS-001 Legal and Data Inventory Baseline | Legal, Privacy and Security | APPROVED | PR [#6](https://github.com/Bear78888/bizmetria.ai/pull/6), merge SHA `b6174f1325136bc69a9859925c570e5770972991` |
| PS-002 Owner Decision Package | Product Strategy / Master Control | READY | Both required inputs are approved; no active execution branch yet |
| MC-003 Owner Decision Gate | Master Orchestrator / owner | PLANNED | Begins only after approved PS-002 |
| FA-001 and all later delivery tasks | Applicable workstreams | PLANNED | Follow the dependencies and gates in the Delivery Roadmap |

The complete sequence is in [`docs/control/DELIVERY_ROADMAP.md`](control/DELIVERY_ROADMAP.md); exact per-workstream state is in [`docs/control/WORKSTREAM_REGISTRY.md`](control/WORKSTREAM_REGISTRY.md).

## Recovered drafts

Workstream 04 retains the recovered detailed free-audit field/options baseline and score mapping/result-selection baseline. They remain drafts until `FA-001` tests and approves or replaces them.

## Open decisions

The following remain unresolved and must not be silently approved:

- paid-report delivery deadline;
- Refund Policy;
- consultation format and duration;
- technology stack;
- voice/telephony vendor;
- CRM and email vendor;
- promotion names, cadence, eligibility, and expiration;
- implementation packages and prices;
- final tested score point table.

The Decision Log and Delivery Roadmap name the task and gate responsible for each item.

## Immediate next action

Assign `PS-002` as one bounded Product Strategy task. It must present independently answerable options, tradeoffs, recommendations, and downstream effects for the owner decisions without silently approving them. Do not start `MC-003` until PS-002 is reviewed and merged, and do not start Phase 2 until `G1` passes.

## Operational safeguards

- `main` is the only approved repository state.
- Do not write directly to `main`.
- One task uses one temporary branch and one draft PR.
- Remote task branches are canonical live-locks.
- Default WIP is two execution tasks plus one PR review.
- Keep `test/chatgpt-write-access` unchanged.
- Batch related writes and follow [`docs/control/GITHUB_SAFE_OPERATING_POLICY.md`](control/GITHUB_SAFE_OPERATING_POLICY.md).
- Implement off-platform backups separately under [`docs/control/BACKUP_AND_CONTINUITY_POLICY.md`](control/BACKUP_AND_CONTINUITY_POLICY.md).
